# InterviewExercise
Java exercise I created for my buddy to practice Streams, creating mappers and writing tests.
(Java, Streams, Mapper, Assertj, Junit5)

## What to do?

Download this project and open it in your favourite IDE. This project is somewhat of online shop backend.
Fill missing methods in services, according to cues, add missing controller method body and provide tests for your code!

This project already contains AssertJ and JUnit libraries. You could use some other libraries (like Apache Commons Utils) but it's not necessary to finish this task.
